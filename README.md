## Project Overview

FinanceOS is a multi-user financial dashboard system where users have different levels of access based on their role. The system supports creating and managing financial records (income/expenses), viewing dashboard analytics, and managing users — all protected by JWT-based authentication and role-based permission classes.

**Key features:**

- JWT authentication (login, register, token refresh)
- Three-tier role system: Viewer, Analyst, Admin
- Full CRUD on financial records with soft delete
- Dashboard analytics: totals, category breakdown, monthly/weekly trends
- Filter records by type, category, date range, and keyword search
- Pagination on all list endpoints
- Custom permission classes enforced at the view level
- Complete dark-themed frontend served directly from Django

## Role System

The system has three roles with increasing levels of access:

| Permission | Viewer | Analyst | Admin |
|-----------|:------:|:-------:|:-----:|
| View financial records | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Search and filter records | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Dashboard summary (totals, balance) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Analytics charts and trends | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Monthly and weekly trend data | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Create financial records | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Edit financial records | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Delete records (soft delete) | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| List and manage users | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Change user roles and status | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

Roles are enforced using custom DRF permission classes in `api/permissions.py`:

- `IsAdminRole` — only users with `role = 'admin'`
- `IsAnalystOrAbove` — users with `role = 'analyst'` or `role = 'admin'`
- `IsViewerOrAbove` — any authenticated active user

## Frontend Pages

The frontend is a multi-page application served directly by Django. No separate server or build step needed.

| URL | Page | Who can see it |
|-----|------|---------------|
| `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` | Login / Register | Everyone |
| `http://127.0.0.1:8000/dashboard/` | Dashboard with stats and charts | All logged-in users |
| `http://127.0.0.1:8000/records/` | Records table with filters | All logged-in users |
| `http://127.0.0.1:8000/analytics/` | Charts and trend analysis | Analyst + Admin |
| `http://127.0.0.1:8000/users/` | User management | Admin only |
| `http://127.0.0.1:8000/profile/` | My account and permissions | All logged-in users |
| `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` | Django admin panel | Superuser |

**Frontend files:**

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `templates/login.html` | Sign in and register page |
| `templates/pages/dashboard.html` | Stats cards, monthly bar chart, category donut |
| `templates/pages/records.html` | Paginated table, filters, add/edit/delete modals |
| `templates/pages/analytics.html` | Weekly trends, category breakdowns, net balance |
| `templates/pages/users.html` | User cards with role editing |
| `templates/pages/profile.html` | Account info and role permission matrix |
| `static/css/base.css` | Shared design tokens and all component styles |

## Deployment on Render

## Design Decisions

**Custom User model with role field**
Using a `role` field directly on the User model rather than Django's Groups system keeps role logic simple and explicit. The `is_admin` and `is_analyst` properties on the model mean role checks read naturally throughout the codebase.

**JWT over session authentication**
JWT is stateless and scales horizontally without a shared session store. It also avoids Django's CSRF requirement, which would complicate the frontend API calls. The `SessionAuthentication` backend is intentionally excluded from `DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES`.

**Soft delete on records**
Financial data should never be permanently destroyed. Setting `is_deleted = True` hides records from all API responses while preserving them in the database for audit purposes. A hard delete is not exposed anywhere in the API.

**Separate views folder**
Splitting views into `auth_views.py`, `user_views.py`, `record_views.py`, and `dashboard_views.py` keeps each file focused and under 100 lines, making the codebase easy to navigate.

**Django serves the frontend**
Serving HTML templates directly from Django eliminates the need for a separate frontend server, CORS complexity in production, and any build pipeline. The frontend is plain HTML/CSS/JS — no framework, no npm, no compilation step.

**SQLite for development, easy to swap**
SQLite requires zero configuration and works immediately. Switching to PostgreSQL for production requires only changing the `DATABASES` setting — the rest of the code is unchanged.

---

## Assumptions & Tradeoffs

- Role assignment is open during registration for demonstration purposes. In a real production system, only admins would be able to assign the `admin` or `analyst` roles.
- SQLite is used for local development. Render's free tier does not persist SQLite data between deploys — use PostgreSQL (via `dj-database-url`) for persistent production data.
- Pagination is set to 20 records per page by default, configurable via `page_size` query parameter.
- The `is_deleted` flag is never exposed as a writable field from the API — it can only be set by the DELETE endpoint.
- Token refresh is the client's responsibility. Access tokens expire after 8 hours; refresh tokens after 7 days.
